Artist statement


As an artist my goal is to explore nonâ€“physical concepts and ideas through two dimensional art. 
I take ideas that I find a jovial interest in from conceptual fields such as mathematics, science, and philosophy, and reduce them down to their bare minimum in order to visually represent my own sense of curiosity when it comes to said topics.

The work itself is not to be viewed as a celebration of whichever intangible concept may be at hand. The point is not so much to impart understanding upon the viewer as it is to create art that shows a flat representation of a concept in my own psyche. I want to explore an idea of art that is critical of the egotistical intellectual. I want to make an oddity of abstract art and the topics expressed by the ultramodern creative. Creating art with the mundane aesthetic of established societal institutions creates a juxtaposition between the light-hearted nature of my own image and the intensity of the intellectual community.

My work imparts on the attestant the entanglement of intelligentsia and the vainglorious essence of the craftsman. It foolheartedly delves into the fugazi of culture that is moneyed society and the means in which this system imparts on the lifeblood of the entity that is our huxleyan ecosphere. Amongst the malthusian supercapitalist forecast that is the opisthoporan residential framework, there is a sine qua non for the disembarkment from traditional storytelling and commentary. It is paramount that we endure as untethered homunculi emancipated from the constraints of our survival.
