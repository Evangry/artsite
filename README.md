## basic git instructions for non-programmers once they are set up:
1. in git bash, navigate to artsite repository (directory/folder)
2. git pull to reflect what's on github
3. make your changes (add image files to `/pieces`, add image data for site visitors)
4. `git add *` and also `git status` to confirm your changes are what you want them to be
5. `git commit -am "whatever commit name I choose"` or `git stash` if you want to throw away your changes
